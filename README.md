# Odin Recipes

Welcome to Odin Recipes! This project is part of my journey to learn web development with The Odin Project. Here, I'll be creating a collection of recipes using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of basic web development concepts, including:

- HTML structure and semantics
- Git version control
- GitHub collaboration
